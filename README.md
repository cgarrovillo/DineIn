## PricedMenu
Me and my friends are tired of wanting to try out a new food spot and later finding out they don't post the prices of food on their online menu. Good business strategy--hurts people like us
Yelp/Google reviews prices are either years old or too much to sort through

### The idea (in theory)
An online platform for foodies to submit pictures of menus for many others to look at

### Why this project?
I'd like to get more experience in ReactJS, JS, CSS, Responsive web design, Firebase
